# Project Title:  Java Price_Display

## Motivation: 
In this project I will build a basic 'price display' programme using Java. <br />

## Objectives:
Write a new class PriceDisplay with a main method that defines two variables:<br />
One holding an item name (such as "Coffee machine")<br />
One holding a non-integer price (such as 15.99)<br />
Use System.out.printf and the format specifiers (using %) to print a string such as "The price for the item Coffee machine is 15.99"<br />

## Notes:
Note how the type of variables are specified by, the programmer instead of inferred by the compiler.<br />
